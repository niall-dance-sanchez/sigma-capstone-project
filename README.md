    Penalty shootout game which challenges the user to unlock better players by winning shootouts. 
    Shootouts follow regular football rules with a toss to decide who to go first. 
    Goals are determined by comparing the average of the penalty taker or goalkeeper's stats with a randomly generated number between 1-100 (The greater number wins). 
    The user can unlock players by earning enough points through scoring goals and winning shootouts. 
    More points can be earned by winning shootouts of a harder difficulty (there are 4 levels of difficulty). 
    The user can end the game after every shootout and their stats will be displayed at the end.
