Penalty shootout game which challenges the user to unlock better players and score as many points as possible by winning shootouts:  
	- Shootouts follow regular football rules with a simulated coin toss before each shootout to decide which player takes first.  
	- Goals are determined by comparing the average of the statistics of the user's penalty taker or goalkeeper with a randomly 
 	  generated number between 0-99 (The greater number wins). 
	- The opponent gains an advantage by winning the coin toss which will add an advantage of 5% to the range of the random number (i.e. 4-104) 
 	  to reflect the real life advantage of taking first.  
	- The user earns points for scoring goals and winning shootouts and is deducted points for losing shootouts. 
	- There are 4 levels of difficulty (Easy, Intermediate, Hard, Very Hard), which increase the opponent's advamtage by 10% for each step up in difficulty.
	- More points are earned by winning shootouts of a harder difficulty. 
	- Earning points allows the user to unlock better penalty takers and goalkeepers which are selected before each shootout.  
	- The user can end the game after every shootout and their points and number of shootouts played will be displayed at the end.
